This library supports one control `NavigationViewEx` which is intended to add common functionality to NavigationView.
As it extends NavigationView it is only available for projects targeting Windows 10 Fall Creators Edition (10.0; Build 16299) and higher.

This project is based on code samples from [Jerry Nixon's MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt814416) about the new control, filled out a bit to be easier to integrate into my own projects.

This is such basic functionality copyright is pointless so it's [unlicensed](https://unlicense.org/). Use it however you want.
